# Movement and the Machine 

#### Instruction Set 
1. This is an earlier version of a passion project that I will continue to develop.
2. Currently, the music is composed by 2 primary movements, hinted in the accompanying poetry.
3. Bring your hands closer together to trigger new chords.
4. Raise them high up above to trigger a key change (also signified in the background color change).
